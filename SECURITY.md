## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you spot a vulnerability in my app, please create an issue with the label "vulnerability" (if it does not automatically get assigned to it) describing the vulnerability issue.

A response of a vulnerability will come in 1-2 weeks from the report. If the vulnerability report is accepted, fixing of said vulnerability will initiate, if it is declined, 
the issue will be closed and the reporter will be notified with an explanation.
